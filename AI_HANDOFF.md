## Core Architecture

| Engine | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| SynthEngine | 16-voice classic (3 osc/voice: Classic or Wavetable) / 8-voice FM |
| GranularEngine | 16-voice granular, 32 grains/voice (512 total), file or built-in source |
| DrumSequencer | Sample-based, 32 voices |
| SamplerEngine | Zone-based playback, 16 voices |
| Effects | Chorus → Distortion → EQ → Compressor → Delay → Reverb (reorderable chain) |
| ModulationMatrix | LFO + envelope routing to all DSP params |
| Sequencer / ProSequencer / Arpeggiator / PatternEngine | MIDI generation |

## Signal Flow

```
MIDI → Sequencer → SynthEngine   ─┐
MIDI → GranularEngine            ─┤
MIDI → DrumSequencer             ─┼─► Effect Chain ──► Output
MIDI → SamplerEngine             ─┘
ModulationMatrix → all DSP parameters (pitch, cutoff, volume, …)
```

**Effect chain** (default order, drag-to-reorder in UI):
`Chorus → Distortion → EQ → Compressor → Delay → Reverb`
Reverb is always applied as a stereo block op; the chain correctly splits pre/post around it.

## What Works

- SynthEngine (16-voice classic with 3 osc/voice + FM 8-voice), DrumSequencer, SamplerEngine — all produce audio ✅
- GranularEngine (16-voice × 32 grains, 4 env shapes, pitch scatter, spray, density, stereo spread, file loading) ✅
- 3 oscillators per voice: Classic (math-based) or Wavetable (2048-sample table, 4 waves, position scan) ✅
- Voice modes: Poly / Mono / Legato with portamento (per-sample semitone-space glide) ✅
- All 6 effects with full parameter control and MIDI Learn ✅
- Effect chain reordering — drag-to-reorder strip, order persists in presets ✅
- ModulationMatrix — LFO → pitch/cutoff/volume/effects ✅
- Melodic Sequencer, DAW transport sync ✅
- Full state persistence (XML) including 3 oscillators + effect chain order + granular source path ✅
- MIDI Learn on all effect panel knobs ✅
- Undo/Redo (Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z) ✅
- Filter oversampling (Off/2x/4x/Auto) ✅
- Preset system (XML) with Factory/User banks ✅
- Dark Forge UI theme (`MultiverseTheme`) — neumorphic knobs, sliders, buttons, tabs, menus ✅
- NeuKnob (`Source/NeuKnob.h/.cpp`) — value pill on hover/drag, amber arc when macro-assigned ✅
- SynthDisplay (`Source/Synth/SynthDisplay.h/.cpp`) — real-time oscilloscope (left) + FFT spectrum (right), 30 Hz, lock-free FIFO ✅

## What Is Broken / Unconnected
- None

## Conventions & Gotchas

- Include JUCE as `<JuceHeader.h>` (angle brackets) — do not revert to quoted path.
- Sampler class is `MvSamplerVoice` — renamed to avoid conflict with `juce::SamplerVoice`.
- Font: `juce::Font(size, style)` still compiles in JUCE 8 but is deprecated — use `juce::Font(juce::FontOptions{}.withHeight(size))` for new code. Old form raises `-Wdeprecated-declarations` but does not break the build.
- `juce::TextEditor::caretColourId` does not exist in JUCE 8 — do not use it.
- `juce::TableHeaderComponent::separatorColourId` does not exist in JUCE 8 — do not use it.
- `MultiverseTheme` (`Source/MultiverseTheme.h/.cpp`) is the global LookAndFeel installed in `PluginEditor`. Dark Forge palette constants (`bgBase`, `bgRaised`, `bgDeep`, `accentBlue`, etc.) are `static const` members — include `MultiverseTheme.h` to access them from panels.
- `MultiverseTheme::drawNeumorphicRect()` is `public static` — callable from panel paint() for section card borders without subclassing.
- `ModulationMatrix::getActiveConnectionsForTarget()` returns by value (thread-safety fix — do not change to ref/pointer).
- Effect chain order is packed as 6 nibbles in `std::atomic<uint32_t> effectChainOrder` — `getChainSlot(pos)` / `swapChainSlots(a,b)` are the only API.
- New effects (Chorus/Distortion/EQ/Compressor) have stereo L/R instances (`chorus[2]`, etc.); Delay is shared mono.
- `EQEffect::updateCoeffs()` uses biquad math per setter call (once per block from processBlock) — no heap allocation.
- Voice mode glide runs **per-sample** in `processBuffer` using `std::exp2((semitone - 69) / 12)` — only active in Mono/Legato, skipped entirely in Poly.
- Mono note stack is `int monoNoteStack[16]` + `int monoNoteCount` in SynthEngine (no heap alloc). Stack is cleared in `allNotesOff()`.
- `Voice::setFrequencyDirect(hz)` sets `baseFrequency` and calls `updateOscillatorFrequencies()` without touching the envelope — used by the glide loop.
- `Voice::setNoteLegato(note)` updates `midiNote` + `baseFrequency` only — no envelope retrigger. Used in Legato mode on gate-open note changes.
- APVTS params added by Phase A: `voiceMode` (Choice 0–2), `portamento` (Float 0–2s), `portaAlways` (Bool).
- GranularEngine source buffer: `juce::ScopedTryLock` in processBlock (non-blocking); if lock fails, silence for that block — safe for audio thread.
- GranularVoice grain pool: `GrainState grains[32]` — stack-allocated, no heap. Grain steal: first inactive slot, fallback index 0.
- Granular pitch ratio: `exp2f((midiNote - 60) / 12.0f)` × `exp2f(scatterSemitones / 12.0f)`.
- GranularEngine file loading: `juce::LagrangeInterpolator` for resampling, stereo conversion, writes under `juce::ScopedLock`.
- MPE Lower Zone: ch 1 = master (global bend ±2 st, CC64/66/1/123), ch 2–15 = member (per-note bend ±48 st, channel pressure, CC74 slide).
- `VoiceInfo::midiChannel` (0 = unassigned; 2–15 for MPE). `MpeChannelState[16]` in SynthEngine holds pitchBend/pressure/slide per channel.
- MPE channel state reset on `noteOnMPE()` — prevents stale pitch bend bleed when a channel is recycled.
- CC74 neutral value is 63 (not 0); normalised to -1..+1 before storing in `mpeChannels[].slide`.
- `ModSourceType::MPEPressure` and `ModSourceType::MPESlide` are the two new mod sources; fed from most-recent member-channel message.
- `NeuKnob` extends `MidiLearnSlider` — use NeuKnob everywhere you'd use MidiLearnSlider; it's a drop-in. Value pill fires from paint() (isMouseOver/isMouseButtonDown check). Amber arc managed by ArcTimer (inner juce::Timer struct, 10 Hz), calls setColour/removeColour only on state change to avoid repaint storms. `MultiverseTheme::drawRotarySlider` uses `slider.findColour(rotarySliderFillColourId)` — component-level setColour overrides the LookAndFeel color.
- `juce::Font::getStringWidthFloat` does not exist in this project's JUCE version — use character-count estimation or `getStringWidth` (int) for pill sizing.
- `SynthDisplay`: lives at `Source/Synth/SynthDisplay.h/.cpp`. Ring buffer: `RING_SIZE=2048`, `ringWritePos` (masked with `& (RING_SIZE-1)`). FFT: `juce::dsp::FFT fft{FFT_ORDER}` (order 10, 1024-point). Audio data arrives via `PluginProcessor::pullDisplaySamples(float*, int)` (public, message-thread safe). `pushDisplaySamples` is private, called at end of processBlock after pan.
- `PresetBrowserPanel` (`Source/Presets/PresetBrowserPanel.h/.cpp`): inherits `juce::ListBoxModel` + `Button::Listener` + `ComboBox::Listener`. Uses `juce::ListBox presetList`. Shown as 160px collapsible panel above tabs in `PluginEditor` (toggled by "Presets" button in header). `refresh()` calls `presetList.updateContent()`. Phase 4 redesign: keep all logic, only change `paint()`, `resized()`, `paintListBoxItem()`, and visual styling.
